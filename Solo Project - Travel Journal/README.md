## About Scrimba

At Scrimba our goal is to create the best possible coding school at the cost of a gym membership! 💜
If we succeed with this, it will give anyone who wants to become a software developer a realistic shot at succeeding, regardless of where they live and the size of their wallets 🎉
The Frontend Developer Career Path aims to teach you everything you need to become a Junior Developer, or you could take a deep-dive with one of our advanced courses 🚀
